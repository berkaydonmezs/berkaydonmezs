### I'm Berkay 

I enjoy coding in **Python** and **Fortran**, and am interested in climate and atmospheric modeling.

You should see [**climaturk**](https://climaturk.com/) and my online [**portfolio**](https://berkaydonmezs.github.io/).

$$
\zeta(atmosphere) = \int_{weather}^{climate} t^{init}e^{projection}dt\
$$

You should also see our recent [**article**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101316) on urbanization-precipitation interaction in Ankara.
